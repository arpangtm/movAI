## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Personalized Dashboard
Users can input their favorite:
- Genres
- Directors
- Actors
- Movies

Based on these preferences, the app dynamically generates a customized homepage filled with tailored recommendations and content.

### 🤖 Smart Recommendation Bot
An intelligent bot suggests movies and provides detailed metadata including:
- Genre
- IMDb rating
- Overview
- Poster and release info

Each movie has its own dedicated page at `/movies/:movieId`, with data fetched in real-time from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

### 🔐 User Authentication
- Authentication is handled via [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)
- A webhook is triggered on sign-in to store user data in **Amazon DynamoDB**

### 🔄 Real-Time Recommendation Updates
- A **DynamoDB Stream** monitors changes to the `interests` field in user profiles
- When updated, a **Lambda function** is triggered to:
  - Query an LLM-based recommendation engine
  - Store the updated movie suggestions back into DynamoDB

### 📑 Watchlist Management
Users can create and manage personalized watchlists to keep track of movies they want to see or revisit.
